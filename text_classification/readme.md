NLP : Text Classification:

Here I use the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset to train the model. The training data has 2 classes: positive review and negative review.

Machine Learning Algorithms used for model building: 
a. Naive Bayes
b. Logistic Regression
c. SVM

Different combinations of Data Preprocessing techniques are tried, like: Stop Words Removal, Stemming (Porter Stemmer), Lemmatization.
Frequency based Word Embeddings - TFIDF are used as features with Unigram, Bigram and Trigram variants.
